# 🧪 Nova Suite Labs

Welcome to **Nova Suite Labs** — the experimental and open source division of [Nova Suite](https://novasuite.one), built and maintained by [xxavvTechnologies](https://xxavvgroup.com/technologies).

Nova Suite Labs is where we explore new ideas, release open tools, test feature concepts, and collaborate with the community to shape the future of Nova Suite.

## 🌐 What is Nova Suite Labs?

Nova Suite Labs is a home for:

- 🧰 **Open source utilities** used across Nova Suite apps
- 🔬 **Experimental tools & prototypes** not yet production-ready
- 📊 **Developer-facing APIs** and internal integrations
- 🤖 **AI-assisted workflows** and research models
- 📡 **Early feature previews** before they go live in Nova Suite

If it's forward-thinking, a little weird, or still in development — it lives here.
